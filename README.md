## Steps
Migrating emails from Gmail to Outlook using the **IMAP migration** method:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Gmail Account for IMAP Migration

1. **Enable IMAP Access in Gmail**:
   - Log in to your **Gmail** account.
   - Go to **Settings** (click on the gear icon in the top-right corner).
   - Navigate to **See all settings**.
   - Click on the **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** tab.
   - In the **IMAP Access** section, select **Enable IMAP**.
   - Click **Save Changes**.

2. **Generate App Password for Gmail (If Using 2-Step Verification)**:
   - Go to your **Google Account Security** settings.
   - Scroll down to **Signing in to Google** and select **App Passwords**.
   - Generate an app-specific password for Outlook or migration.

### Step 2: Prepare Outlook for IMAP Migration

1. **Ensure You Have Outlook Admin Permissions**:
   - If you are migrating for an organization, make sure you have **admin privileges** in **Outlook Admin Center** or **Exchange Admin Center (EAC)**.

2. **Set Up Outlook Email Account**:
   - If not already configured, set up your **Microsoft 365** or **Outlook.com** account.

### Step 3: Start the IMAP Migration

1. **Log in to Exchange Admin Center (EAC)**:
   - Navigate to the **Exchange Admin Center** using your Microsoft 365 login credentials.
   - Go to **recipients > migration**.

2. **Create a New Migration Batch**:
   - Select **New Migration Batch** by clicking the **"+" (plus)** button.
   - Choose **IMAP Migration** from the list of options.

3. **Prepare a CSV File for Migration**:
   - The CSV file will contain the list of Gmail users and their Gmail credentials (email addresses, usernames, and passwords).
   - **Format** the CSV like this:
     ```
     EmailAddress,UserName,Password
     user1@gmail.com,user1@gmail.com,app-password1
     user2@gmail.com,user2@gmail.com,app-password2
     ```

4. **Upload the CSV File**:
   - After selecting **IMAP migration**, upload the CSV file.
   - Outlook will start verifying the users.

5. **Configure IMAP Settings for Gmail**:
   - In the **IMAP Server** settings, enter the following details:
     - IMAP Server: `imap.gmail.com`
     - Port: `993`
     - Encryption: **SSL**

6. **Configure Migration Settings**:
   - Choose **Migrate all data** or select specific data ranges.
   - Set a **migration endpoint** if necessary, using the settings above.

7. **Start Migration Batch**:
   - Name your migration batch.
   - Select **Automatically start the migration batch** or **Manually start**.
   - Click **New** to create the batch.

### Step 4: Monitor the Migration

1. **View the Migration Status**:
   - Once started, go to **recipients > migration** in the Exchange Admin Center.
   - Monitor the progress of your migration batch.

### Step 5: Complete the Migration

1. **Complete the Migration Batch**:
   - Once the migration is completed successfully, select the migration batch and click **Complete**.

2. **Test Outlook Account**:
   - After the migration, log into the Outlook account to verify that emails have been migrated properly.

### Step 6: Update DNS Settings (For Domain Migration)

If you are moving the domain from Gmail to Outlook (e.g., moving from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365):

1. **Update MX Records**:
   - Modify the **MX records** in your domain registrar's control panel to point to Microsoft 365’s mail servers.

2. **Confirm Propagation**:
   - After updating, confirm the DNS changes have propagated successfully.

Step 1: Generate App Password for Gmail
If you're using 2-Step Verification on your Gmail account, you’ll need to create an app-specific password to use for the IMAP migration.

Steps to Generate an App Password:
Log in to Your Google Account:

Go to Google Account.
Click on Security in the left-side panel.
Navigate to App Passwords:

Scroll down to the Signing in to Google section.
Click on App Passwords (you’ll only see this option if 2-Step Verification is turned on).
Select App and Device:

In the Select app dropdown, choose Mail.
In the Select device dropdown, choose the device you’ll use for migration (e.g., Windows PC).
Generate the App Password:

Click Generate.
A 16-character password will appear. Copy this password (you will use it during migration in place of your regular Gmail password).

Step 2: Use the App Password for IMAP Migration.
With the app password generated, proceed with the steps for IMAP migration, using the app password in place of your regular Gmail password.

Update CSV File for Migration
Prepare Your CSV File:

In the CSV file (used for migration in Exchange Admin Center), use the app password in the Password field.
Example:


EmailAddress,UserName,Password
user1@gmail.com,user1@gmail.com,your-app-password-here
user2@gmail.com,user2@gmail.com,your-app-password-here
Continue with Migration Steps:

## FAQ

#### Question 1. What is IMAP Migration?
Answer  :- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) migration is a method of transferring emails from one email system (e.g., Gmail) to another (e.g., Outlook or Microsoft 365) using the IMAP protocol.



#### Question 2. What data is migrated during IMAP migration?
Answer  :- IMAP migration transfers emails only. It does not migrate contacts, calendars, tasks, or any other non-email data.

#### Question 3. Is IMAP migration suitable for large organizations?
Answer  :- IMAP migration is suitable for small to medium-sized migrations. However, for large migrations or complex requirements (like calendar and contacts), a dedicated migration tool (e.g., Microsoft Migration Manager, MigrationWiz) is often recommended.

#### Question 4. How long does IMAP migration take?
Answer  :- The duration depends on the number of mailboxes, amount of data, and network speed. It can range from a few hours to several days.

#### Question 5. Do users experience any downtime during IMAP migration?
Answer  :- No, IMAP migration does not usually cause downtime for users. They can continue using their email accounts during the migration process.

#### Question 6. What should I do if my Gmail mailbox is 70 GB, but I only have 50 GB of storage available in Outlook? Can I archive emails as a PST file?

Answer:
If your Gmail mailbox is 70 GB, but your Outlook mailbox has a storage limit of 50 GB, you can archive older emails by exporting them to a PST (Personal Storage Table) file. This way, you can keep the most recent emails in your Outlook mailbox while storing the older emails separately in the PST file.
